# MLOPS demo

MLOps, an abbreviation for Machine Learning Operations, embodies the fusion of DevOps methodologies with machine learning practices. This comprehensive MLOps course is designed to walk you through a complete MLOps project, encompassing all stages from data ingestion to deployment. Throughout the course, you will gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge tools such as ZenML, MLflow, and a range of other MLOps libraries.

In this project we make use of pipelines for data cleaning, model training, evaluation and deployment. We are applying basic Linear Regression Model on customer satisfaction dataset where the label or target value is review_score as in continous values. Thus this becomes a regression problem. The pipelines collect data from dataframe -> clean the data -> split the data -> Apply the Linear Regression Model -> Evaluate results (r2 score, RMSE, MSE) -> Further is getting deployed.

ZenML is used to check and monitor production-ready machine learning pipelines.
